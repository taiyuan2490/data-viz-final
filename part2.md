Below are just draft

## General trend
<img width="742" height="247" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8330736f-6a33-4c8a-a0e4-ed663cd3171f" />
<img width="778" height="502" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9861460e-1d22-404e-9f2e-2ca7b0398063" />

From 1975 to 2024, light trucks surged from 20% to over 80% of U.S. auto sales. This dramatic shift reflects evolving consumer lifestyles, fuel economics, and design preferences—marking a decisive move away from sedans toward larger, more powerful vehicles.

## Impact to CO2 emission:
<img width="1584" height="944" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/280c0e4a-78bf-4a90-a7ec-fa395a93034b" />

From 1975 to 2020, average vehicle horsepower doubled while CO₂ emissions halved. This chart highlights how engineering innovations enabled cleaner, more powerful cars. 

<img width="1073" height="615" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d085fae-fdc5-48c7-aa56-11c27b9f4262" />

Yet the gains weren’t uniform—pickups lagged in emissions progress. From 1980 to 2020, pickup trucks tripled in horsepower while other vehicles doubled. Yet emissions fell modestly for pickups and significantly for others. The chart reveals a growing imbalance: rising consumer demand for power, especially in pickups, outpaced environmental progress

<img width="832" height="395" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/18d57d38-f393-4e0d-9d33-a7dc2fc5396b" />
Using other car's horsepower and co2 as benchmark, we can see pickups, comparing to other car, are having more power, with more pollution.


## Impact to road safety
<img width="790" height="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55461a7f-4c7c-42df-b865-46adbcc033c0" />

From 1994 to 2010, U.S. fatalities per 100M vehicle miles steadily declined, then fluctuated modestly afterward.

<img width="796" height="389" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/97bea995-f09f-4576-8f7d-44dddb460072" />
After 2010, light truck share surged while fatalities per 100M miles reversed their long decline, suggesting a possible causal relationship between rising pickup dominance and deteriorating road safety outcomes.


## EV adoption
<img width="796" height="664" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b497ef7-83df-4734-afc3-e3bc23b63525" />

<img width="859" height="655" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e0d41067-dee9-4cbe-8b91-9b679522a0c0" />

In 2014, the United States led global EV adoption with nearly half of the market, while China trailed. By 2024, China surged to over 60%, overtaking both the U.S. and EU. This dramatic shift underscores China’s dominance in scaling EV adoption and the relative decline of U.S. leadership.

## User Research Protocol & Findings

### Protocol

**Objective**  
The purpose of this user research was to evaluate whether the storyboard and draft data visualizations clearly communicated the intended story:  
1. U.S. consumers have increasingly shifted toward larger vehicles (pickups and SUVs).  
2. This shift has slowed progress on CO₂ reduction and increased pedestrian risks.  
3. The U.S. is lagging behind peers such as China and the EU in adopting electric vehicles (EVs).  

The goal was to test clarity, accessibility, and persuasiveness of the visuals for a general audience.

**Target Audience**  
- General readers aged 20–40 with interest in environment, transportation, or public policy.  
- No requirement for technical knowledge of vehicles, emissions, or statistics.  

**Recruitment Strategy**  
- At least three participants representing diverse backgrounds (student, office worker, car owner).  
- No personally identifiable information was collected. Participants were described in general terms.  

**Interview Script**  
1. What is the main story you take away from the draft?  
2. Which chart is the clearest or most persuasive to you? Why?  
3. Which chart is the most confusing or hardest to interpret? Why?  
4. Do the annotations, labels, and legends provide enough clarity?  
5. After reviewing the draft, what is your overall impression of the U.S. auto market story?  

**Evaluation Criteria**  
- At least 2 of 3 participants restate the main narrative accurately.  
- Identify strongest and weakest charts.  
- Gather at least 3 actionable suggestions for improvements.  
- Capture at least one direct participant quote per interview.

### Interview Findings
**Participant 1 (Student, 20s)**  
- **Main takeaway**: “Pickups are getting stronger but dirtier, and EVs aren’t catching up.” The participant immediately understood the narrative of vehicle size, emissions stagnation, and EV lag, which aligned with the project’s core message.  
- **Most useful**: EV adoption chart — the global comparison (U.S. vs. EU vs. China) was very intuitive. They mentioned that seeing the U.S. line so much lower than Europe and China “made the lag really obvious.”  
- **Confusing**: CO₂ vs. HP gap shading chart — meaning of color scale unclear. The participant struggled to interpret what darker vs. lighter meant without a numeric anchor. They suggested: “Maybe put actual numbers on top of the bars so it’s not just color.”  
- **Additional notes**: Felt some line charts were “busy” and recommended switching to bar charts for clarity, especially when comparing two groups in a single year. This directly informed the decision to turn the CO₂ line plot into a grouped bar chart.  
- **Quote**: “I get that pickups are worse, but can you show *how much worse* more directly?”  

---

**Participant 2 (Office Worker, 30s)**  
- **Main takeaway**: “Road safety improved until 2010, then slowed down, maybe due to more trucks.” They tied the trend to vehicle size and appreciated the narrative flow from market changes to safety consequences.  
- **Most useful**: Fatalities chart — especially the split shading between 2000–2010 and 2010–now. They said this visual “told the story in one glance” and called it the clearest evidence in the draft.  
- **Confusing**: Dual-axis chart of CO₂ and HP — axes and units were not immediately clear. They admitted that once the labels were explained, it was persuasive, but initially it looked “too technical.”  
- **Additional notes**: Asked whether CO₂ was “grams per mile” or “per gallon,” pointing out the importance of explicit units. Also suggested clearer captions to guide readers: “Tell me what to look at.”  
- **Quote**: “The split between 2000–2010 and 2010–now is super clear — that really works.”  

---

**Participant 3 (Car Owner, 30s)**  
- **Main takeaway**: “Horsepower keeps going up while CO₂ barely drops — policy isn’t working.” They focused on the divergence between performance and emissions, highlighting policy implications.  
- **Most useful**: Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart (after clarification). They said the chart was powerful once axes were labeled boldly: “You see the horsepower going up like crazy, and CO₂ barely moving.”  
- **Confusing**: Gap chart with abstract shading — the use of gradients without numeric labels left them uncertain. They suggested simplifying the design or switching to a bar-style representation that shows the widening gap explicitly.  
- **Additional notes**: Expressed skepticism about data credibility, asking if CO₂ values were “real-world” or “lab test” values. This pointed to the need for stronger source notes and context to build trust.  
- **Quote**: “Need to know if these are *real-world* CO₂ numbers or just lab tests.”

### Synthesis of Insights

**Consistent Feedback**  
- EV adoption chart and fatalities chart were easiest to understand.  
- Gap chart was visually striking but confusing without clearer legends and labels.  
- Strong demand for **explicit units, labels, and source citations** to increase trust.  

**Conflicting Feedback**  
- Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart was divisive: some participants found it powerful, others found it confusing.  

**Key Insights**  
- Simpler charts (line and bar) communicated better.  
- Abstract charts (gap visualization) required much clearer scaffolding.  
- Participants suggested that in some cases, **bar charts could better highlight differences year-to-year** than line charts.  

---

### Planned Changes Based on Feedback

- **Clarity and Labeling**  
  - Added explicit unit labels (e.g., “Real-world CO₂ emissions (g/mi)”).  
  - Bold axis labels and clearer legends.  
  - Included sources directly beneath each chart.  

- **Gap Visualization**  
  - Replaced detailed shaded gap chart with a **three-step bar gradient (2000, 2010, 2020)** showing how the gap widened.  
  - Used a smoother color transition (light red → dark red) with annotation: “Darker = larger gap.”  

- **Dual-Axis Chart**  
  - Retained chart but clarified axes: left axis = CO₂, right axis = HP.  
  - Added annotation lines to highlight the divergence trend.  

- **Simplification of Line Plots**  
  - Converted the pickup vs. others CO₂ line plot into a **grouped bar chart** for annual differences.  
  - Reduced visual “busyness” by highlighting key years.  

- **Narrative Flow**  
  - Reordered story to: **Market trends → CO₂ and horsepower tradeoffs → Pedestrian safety → EV adoption → Conclusion.**  
  - Added a short **reading guide (2–3 sentences)** at the start to orient readers.  

---

### Conclusion

The research confirmed that the **main narrative is communicated successfully**: pickups and SUVs are larger and more powerful but hinder CO₂ progress, and U.S. EV adoption lags behind peers. At the same time, the testing highlighted **weaknesses in clarity**: legends, units, and abstract charts need simplification.  

Planned revisions — including **bar chart substitutions, simplified gap visualization, stronger labeling, and narrative reordering** — were directly informed by user feedback. The next step (Part III) will focus on polishing design, adding annotations, and testing whether the updated visuals reduce confusion while strengthening impact.
