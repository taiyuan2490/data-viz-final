# Final Project · Part 2 — Storyboard & User Research

## 1) Story Draft
Main message: U.S. auto market shifted to pickups/SUVs → higher horsepower, slower CO₂ cuts, pedestrian safety risks, EV adoption lag.

Outline:
1. Market preference: Cars vs. Light trucks
2. Tech vs. Environment: Horsepower ↑ vs. CO₂ ↓
3. Safety: Fatalities per 100M VMT (2000–2010 vs 2010+)
4. Global comparison: EV adoption (U.S./EU/China)
5. Conclusion & policy takeaways

## 2) Storyboard
High-fidelity draft visuals:
- ![Truck share](images/fig_truck_share.png)
- ![CO₂ vs HP](images/fig_co2_hp.png)
- ![Pickup vs Other Gap](images/fig_gap_abstract.png)
- ![EV adoption](images/fig_ev_regions.png)
- ![Fatalities & Trucks](images/fig_fatalities_truck.png)

Each with 1–2 line takeaway.

## User Research Protocol & Findings

### Protocol

**Objective**  
Test whether the current storyboard and draft data visualizations clearly communicate the key story:  
- U.S. consumers shifted to larger vehicles (pickups/SUVs).  
- This slowed CO₂ reductions and increased pedestrian risks.  
- EV adoption in the U.S. lags behind global peers.  

**Target Audience**  
- General readers (20–40 years old), interested in environment, transport, or policy.  
- Not expected to have deep technical knowledge of vehicles or statistics.  

**Recruitment Strategy**  
- Minimum of 3 participants with varied perspectives (student, office worker, car owner).  
- No personal identifiers recorded.  

**Interview Script (5 Questions)**  
1. What is the main story you take away?  
2. Which chart is the clearest or most persuasive to you? Why?  
3. Which chart is confusing or hard to interpret? Why?  
4. Are the annotations, labels, and legends sufficient?  
5. After reading through, what is your overall impression of the U.S. auto market story?  

**Evaluation Criteria**  
- At least 2 of 3 participants restate the main narrative correctly.  
- Identify best-performing and weakest chart(s).  
- Collect ≥3 actionable suggestions for design improvement.  
- Capture at least one direct quote from each participant.

### Interview Findings

**Participant 1 (Student, 20s)**  
- Main takeaway: “Pickups are getting stronger but dirtier, EVs aren’t catching up.”  
- Most useful: EV adoption chart — global comparison was intuitive.  
- Confusing: Gap chart (pickup vs. other cars) — shading was unclear.  
- Quote: “I get that pickups are worse, but can you show *how much worse* in numbers?”  

**Participant 2 (Office worker, 30s)**  
- Main takeaway: “Roads got safer until 2010, then progress slowed — maybe linked to trucks?”  
- Most useful: Fatalities chart with two shaded eras.  
- Confusing: Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart — axes were unclear.  
- Quote: “The split between 2000–2010 and 2010–now is super clear — that really works.”  

**Participant 3 (Car owner, 30s)**  
- Main takeaway: “Horsepower keeps rising while CO₂ is stuck — policy isn’t working.”  
- Most useful: Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart (after reading labels).  
- Confusing: Abstract gap visualization — color scale wasn’t intuitive.  
- Quote: “Need to know if these are *real-world* CO₂ values or lab tests.”

### Synthesis of Insights

**Consistent Feedback**  
- EV adoption and fatalities charts were easiest to understand.  
- Gap chart was divisive: visually striking but sometimes confusing.  
- Need for clearer labeling: sources, units, legends.  

**Conflicting Feedback**  
- Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart: one participant found it powerful, another found it confusing.  

**Key Insights**  
- Simpler charts worked best.  
- Abstract visualizations require very clear legends.  
- Annotations and context build credibility.  
- **Line plots sometimes feel too “busy.” Participants suggested a bar chart could better highlight year-to-year differences.**

### Planned Changes

- Add **clear source labels and units** (e.g., “Real-world CO₂ emissions (g/mi)”).  
- Revise gap chart legend → darker shading = bigger gap, add numeric annotation.  
- Simplify dual-axis chart: left axis = CO₂, right axis = HP with bold labels.  
- **Change one line plot (pickup vs. others CO₂ gap) into a grouped bar chart** to make annual differences clearer.  
- Reorder story flow: **Market → Tech/CO₂ → Safety → EV → Conclusion**.  
- Add “reading guide” (2–3 sentences) at the start of project site.  


## 6) Optional: Moodboard & Personas
Moodboard: FT/OWID style — muted colors, sharp annotations.  
Persona: Alex (30, policy-focused), wants the main tension in 3 minutes.
