# Final Project · Part 2 — Storyboard & User Research

## 1) Story Draft
Main message: U.S. auto market shifted to pickups/SUVs → higher horsepower, slower CO₂ cuts, pedestrian safety risks, EV adoption lag.

Outline:
1. Market preference: Cars vs. Light trucks
2. Tech vs. Environment: Horsepower ↑ vs. CO₂ ↓
3. Safety: Fatalities per 100M VMT (2000–2010 vs 2010+)
4. Global comparison: EV adoption (U.S./EU/China)
5. Conclusion & policy takeaways

## 2) Storyboard
High-fidelity draft visuals:
- ![Truck share](images/fig_truck_share.png)
- ![CO₂ vs HP](images/fig_co2_hp.png)
- ![Pickup vs Other Gap](images/fig_gap_abstract.png)
- ![EV adoption](images/fig_ev_regions.png)
- ![Fatalities & Trucks](images/fig_fatalities_truck.png)

Each with 1–2 line takeaway.

## 3) User Research Protocol
**Audience**: General readers, policy/environment-focused, not auto experts.  
**Recruit**: 3 diverse participants (student, worker, car owner).  
**Script (5 Qs)**:
1. Is the story clear at first glance?  
2. Which chart is most useful?  
3. Which chart is hardest to understand?  
4. Are annotations/labels sufficient?  
5. What conclusion do you take away?  

**Success criteria**: At least 2 can restate story correctly; clear feedback on best/worst chart; ≥3 actionable suggestions.

## 4) User Interviews — Findings
**P1 (student, 20s)**  
- Likes EV chart, finds gap chart confusing.  
- Quote: “I get pickups are dirtier, but show ‘how much’.”  

**P2 (office worker, 30s)**  
- Safety split very intuitive.  
- Quote: “Big improvement 2000–2010, then stuck.”  

**P3 (car owner, 30s)**  
- Dual-axis clear, but wants source labels.  
- Quote: “Need to know if CO₂ is real-world or lab test.”  

**Synthesis**  
- Agreement: EV & dual-axis easy; need more legends/units.  
- Conflict: Abstract gap chart — love/hate split.  

## 5) Planned Changes
- Add sources/units to all figures.  
- Add clear legend for abstract gap chart.  
- Restructure flow: Market → Tech/CO₂ → Safety → EV → Conclusion.  
- Add “reading guide” at start.

## 6) Optional: Moodboard & Personas
Moodboard: FT/OWID style — muted colors, sharp annotations.  
Persona: Alex (30, policy-focused), wants the main tension in 3 minutes.
