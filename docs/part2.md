# Final Project · Part 2 — Storyboard & User Research

## 1) Story Draft
Main message: U.S. auto market shifted to pickups/SUVs → higher horsepower, slower CO₂ cuts, pedestrian safety risks, EV adoption lag.

Outline:
1. Market preference: Cars vs. Light trucks
2. Tech vs. Environment: Horsepower ↑ vs. CO₂ ↓
3. Safety: Fatalities per 100M VMT (2000–2010 vs 2010+)
4. Global comparison: EV adoption (U.S./EU/China)
5. Conclusion & policy takeaways

## 2) Storyboard

## General trend

From 1975 to 2024, light trucks surged from 20% to over 80% of U.S. auto sales. This dramatic shift reflects evolving consumer lifestyles, fuel economics, and design preferences—marking a decisive move away from sedans toward larger, more powerful vehicles.

## Impact to CO2 emission:

From 1975 to 2020, vehicle horsepower doubled while CO₂ emissions halved. This chart highlights how engineering innovations enabled cleaner, more powerful cars.

Yet the gains weren’t uniform—pickups lagged in emissions progress. From 1980 to 2020, pickup trucks tripled in horsepower while other vehicles doubled. Yet emissions fell modestly for pickups and significantly for others. The chart reveals a growing imbalance: rising consumer demand for power, especially in pickups, outpaced environmental progress

Using other car's horsepower and co2 as benchmark, we can see pickups, comparing to other car, are having more power, with more pollution.


## Impact to road safety

From 1994 to 2010, U.S. fatalities per 100M vehicle miles steadily declined, then fluctuated modestly afterward.

After 2010, light truck share surged while fatalities per 100M miles reversed their long decline, suggesting a possible causal relationship between rising pickup dominance and deteriorating road safety outcomes.


## EV adoption

## User Research Protocol & Findings

### Protocol

**Objective**  
Test whether the current storyboard and draft data visualizations clearly communicate the key story:  
- U.S. consumers shifted to larger vehicles (pickups/SUVs).  
- This slowed CO₂ reductions and increased pedestrian risks.  
- EV adoption in the U.S. lags behind global peers.  

**Target Audience**  
- General readers (20–40 years old), interested in environment, transport, or policy.  
- Not expected to have deep technical knowledge of vehicles or statistics.  

**Recruitment Strategy**  
- Minimum of 3 participants with varied perspectives (student, office worker, car owner).  
- No personal identifiers recorded.  

**Interview Script (5 Questions)**  
1. What is the main story you take away?  
2. Which chart is the clearest or most persuasive to you? Why?  
3. Which chart is confusing or hard to interpret? Why?  
4. Are the annotations, labels, and legends sufficient?  
5. After reading through, what is your overall impression of the U.S. auto market story?  

**Evaluation Criteria**  
- At least 2 of 3 participants restate the main narrative correctly.  
- Identify best-performing and weakest chart(s).  
- Collect ≥3 actionable suggestions for design improvement.  
- Capture at least one direct quote from each participant.

### Interview Findings

**Participant 1 (Student, 20s)**  
- Main takeaway: “Pickups are getting stronger but dirtier, EVs aren’t catching up.”  
- Most useful: EV adoption chart — global comparison was intuitive.  
- Confusing: Gap chart (pickup vs. other cars) — shading was unclear.  
- Quote: “I get that pickups are worse, but can you show *how much worse* in numbers?”  

**Participant 2 (Office worker, 30s)**  
- Main takeaway: “Roads got safer until 2010, then progress slowed — maybe linked to trucks?”  
- Most useful: Fatalities chart with two shaded eras.  
- Confusing: Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart — axes were unclear.  
- Quote: “The split between 2000–2010 and 2010–now is super clear — that really works.”  

**Participant 3 (Car owner, 30s)**  
- Main takeaway: “Horsepower keeps rising while CO₂ is stuck — policy isn’t working.”  
- Most useful: Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart (after reading labels).  
- Confusing: Abstract gap visualization — color scale wasn’t intuitive.  
- Quote: “Need to know if these are *real-world* CO₂ values or lab tests.”

### Synthesis of Insights

**Consistent Feedback**  
- EV adoption and fatalities charts were easiest to understand.  
- Gap chart was divisive: visually striking but sometimes confusing.  
- Need for clearer labeling: sources, units, legends.  

**Conflicting Feedback**  
- Dual-axis CO₂ vs. HP chart: one participant found it powerful, another found it confusing.  

**Key Insights**  
- Simpler charts worked best.  
- Abstract visualizations require very clear legends.  
- Annotations and context build credibility.  
- **Line plots sometimes feel too “busy.” Participants suggested a bar chart could better highlight year-to-year differences.**  

---

### Planned Changes

- Add **clear source labels and units** (e.g., “Real-world CO₂ emissions (g/mi)”).  
- Revise gap chart legend → darker shading = bigger gap, add numeric annotation.  
- Simplify dual-axis chart: left axis = CO₂, right axis = HP with bold labels.  
- **Change one line plot (pickup vs. others CO₂ gap) into a grouped bar chart** to make annual differences clearer.  
- Reorder story flow: **Market → Tech/CO₂ → Safety → EV → Conclusion**.  
- Add “reading guide” (2–3 sentences) at the start of project site.
